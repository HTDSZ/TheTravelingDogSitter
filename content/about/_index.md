    My name is Zoli Hajdu. For as long as I can remember, animals have been at the center of my world. This journey began not as a business, but as a personal mission to provide the kind of care I would want for my own beloved petsâ€”care that is intuitive, attentive, and unwavering. 
    
    I realized that true peace of mind for an owner doesn't come from a checklist of services, but from a deep, implicit trust in the person looking after their home and their best friend. The Traveling Dog Sitter was born from this realization: to offer a service that is less of a transaction and more of a personal commitment to a pet's happiness and an owner's tranquility. My background in photography allows me to not only care for your pet but also to capture the quiet, happy moments, providing you with beautiful, artistic updates that offer a window into their well-being while you're away.
