### What is Reiki?

Reiki is a Japanese energy healing technique that promotes relaxation and reduces stress and anxiety. The word "Reiki" means "mysterious atmosphere, miraculous sign." It is a gentle, non-invasive practice where the practitioner channels energy to the recipient to encourage emotional or physical healing. It is based on the principle that a balanced energy system leads to better overall health.

### How Does Reiki Benefit Dogs?

Animals, especially dogs, are incredibly receptive to the gentle energy of Reiki. They don't have the mental barriers or skepticism that humans can, so they often experience the benefits more quickly and profoundly. Reiki is particularly helpful for:

* **Reducing Anxiety:** It is wonderful for dogs who experience separation anxiety, fear of loud noises, or general nervousness. The calming energy helps them feel safe and secure.
* **Pain Relief:** For senior pets or those with chronic conditions like arthritis, Reiki can help manage pain and provide comfort.
* **Emotional Healing:** For rescue dogs or those who have experienced trauma, Reiki can help release emotional blockages and build trust.
* **End-of-Life Care:** It provides a peaceful, comforting, and supportive experience for pets during their transition.

During a session, I simply create a calm space and offer the Reiki energy to your pet. They are free to accept as much or as little as they want, and they often show their comfort by sighing, stretching, or falling into a deep, restful sleep. It is a beautiful way to enhance the trust and well-being of the animals in my care.
